## How to Use

### Prerequisites
- Windows Server with Active Directory installed
- PowerShell 5.1 or higher
- Domain Administrator privileges

### Onboarding New Users

1. Prepare your CSV file with format:
```csv
   FirstName,LastName,Department,JobTitle
   John,Smith,IT,System Administrator
```

2. Run the onboarding script:
```powershell
   .\Scripts\New-UserOnboarding.ps1
```

3. Verify users in Active Directory Users and Computers

### Offboarding Users

1. Run the offboarding script:
```powershell
   .\Scripts\Remove-UserOffboarding.ps1
```

2. Enter username when prompted
3. Confirm action
4. Check backup in C:\DC-Server\UserBackups\

### Generate Audit Reports
```powershell
.\Scripts\Get-UserAuditReport.ps1
```

Reports are saved with timestamps in the Scripts folder.

## Skills Demonstrated

### Technical Skills
- Active Directory administration
- PowerShell scripting and automation
- Group Policy Object (GPO) management
- Windows Server administration
- File server configuration
- NTFS and share permissions
- Network troubleshooting
- CSV data processing

### Professional Skills
- User lifecycle management
- IT service management workflows
- Security best practices
- Problem-solving and troubleshooting
- Technical documentation
- Process automation
- Attention to detail

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Security Group Naming Consistency
**Problem:** Inconsistent naming caused script failures  
**Solution:** Implemented standardized naming convention (GRP_Department) and created cleanup procedures

### Challenge 2: Network Path Resolution
**Problem:** Home drives not mapping due to incorrect server hostname  
**Solution:** Diagnosed DNS issues and updated scripts with correct server references

### Challenge 3: OU Visibility
**Problem:** Users not visible in standard AD view  
**Solution:** Enabled Advanced Features in ADUC to display all organizational units

### Challenge 4: PowerShell Array Handling
**Problem:** Disabled user count displaying incorrectly  
**Solution:** Implemented proper array syntax (@()) and null checking

### Challenge 5: Multi-OU User Management
**Problem:** Audit script only searched active users  
**Solution:** Expanded search scope to include Disabled_Users OU

## Testing Results

✅ Successfully onboarded 8 test users across 7 departments  
✅ All users correctly placed in departmental OUs  
✅ Home directories created with proper permissions  
✅ Drive mapping functional on client machines  
✅ Group policies applying correctly  
✅ Offboarding process verified with data backup  
✅ Audit reporting accurate and comprehensive  

## Business Value

- **Time Savings:** Reduces onboarding from hours to minutes
- **Consistency:** Zero manual provisioning errors
- **Compliance:** Complete audit trails for regulatory requirements
- **Security:** Proper offboarding with data retention
- **Scalability:** Easy to maintain and expand
- **Professional:** Enterprise-grade IT service management

## Future Enhancements
